# 🚀 Doogle Advanced Ranking Algorithm

## Overview

The Doogle Ranking Algorithm is a sophisticated, multi-factor scoring system designed to deliver highly relevant search results that can compete with major search engines. The algorithm combines traditional information retrieval techniques with modern machine learning approaches and user behavior analysis.

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

**Goal**: Deliver the most relevant, high-quality, and useful results for every search query while learning from user behavior to continuously improve.

**Key Principles**:
- **Relevance First**: Content that best matches user intent ranks highest
- **Quality Matters**: High-quality, authoritative content gets preference
- **User-Centric**: User behavior signals guide ranking decisions
- **Freshness Counts**: Recent, up-to-date content gets appropriate boosts
- **Transparency**: Algorithm behavior is explainable and tunable

## 🔧 Algorithm Architecture

### Multi-Factor Scoring System

The algorithm uses **5 primary ranking factors**, each with configurable weights:

```
Total Score = (Content Relevance × 35%) + 
              (Authority Score × 25%) + 
              (User Signals × 20%) + 
              (Freshness × 10%) + 
              (Quality Score × 10%)
```

### 1. 📝 Content Relevance (35% Default Weight)

**Purpose**: Measures how well content matches the search query

**Components**:
- **Title Matching** (50% of relevance score)
  - Exact phrase matches get highest scores
  - Word boundary matches get bonuses
  - Position-based scoring (earlier matches = better)
  
- **Description Matching** (30% of relevance score)
  - Full-text search with similarity scoring
  - Contextual relevance analysis
  
- **Keywords Matching** (15% of relevance score)
  - Meta keywords analysis
  - Tag-based relevance
  
- **URL Matching** (5% of relevance score)
  - URL path analysis for exact matches
  - Slug-based relevance

**Advanced Features**:
- **Stop Word Filtering**: Common words (the, and, or, etc.) are filtered
- **Stemming**: Handles word variations (search, searching, searched)
- **Phrase Detection**: Multi-word queries are treated as phrases
- **Similarity Scoring**: Uses string similarity algorithms for partial matches

### 2. 👑 Authority Score (25% Default Weight)

**Purpose**: Determines the trustworthiness and authority of content

**Components**:
- **Domain Authority**
  - Well-known domains (Wikipedia, GitHub, etc.) get higher scores
  - Domain age and reputation factors
  - SSL certificate bonus (HTTPS sites get +10%)
  
- **URL Structure Analysis**
  - Shorter paths often indicate more authoritative pages
  - Clean URL structure bonuses
  - Subdomain vs main domain analysis
  
- **Click-Based Authority**
  - Logarithmic scaling of historical click data
  - Popular content gets authority boosts
  - Viral content detection and scoring

**Authority Scoring Examples**:
```
Wikipedia.org = 0.95
GitHub.com = 0.90
StackOverflow.com = 0.85
Medium.com = 0.80
Reddit.com = 0.75
Unknown domains = 0.1-0.3 (based on other factors)
```

### 3. 👥 User Signals (20% Default Weight)

**Purpose**: Incorporates user behavior to improve relevance

**Components**:
- **Click-Through Rate (CTR)**
  - Tracks how often users click on specific results
  - Higher CTR = higher relevance assumption
  - CTR calculated over rolling 30-day window
  
- **Click Volume**
  - Total number of clicks (with logarithmic scaling)
  - Popular content gets visibility boosts
  - Trending content detection
  
- **Recency of Engagement**
  - Recent clicks (last 7 days) get extra weight
  - Trending content identification
  - Seasonal content adjustments

**User Signal Calculation**:
```php
$ctrScore = min(0.4, $clickThroughRate * 2); // Max 40% bonus
$volumeScore = min(0.3, log10($clickCount + 1) / 10);
$recencyScore = min(0.2, $recentClicks / 50);
$userScore = $ctrScore + $volumeScore + $recencyScore;
```

### 4. ⏰ Freshness (10% Default Weight)

**Purpose**: Prioritizes recent and updated content

**Freshness Scoring Scale**:
- **≤ 1 day old**: 1.0 (Perfect freshness)
- **≤ 1 week old**: 0.9 (Very fresh)
- **≤ 1 month old**: 0.7 (Recent)
- **≤ 3 months old**: 0.5 (Moderate)
- **≤ 1 year old**: 0.3 (Old)
- **> 1 year old**: 0.1 (Very old)

**Special Considerations**:
- News and time-sensitive queries get higher freshness weights
- Evergreen content (tutorials, references) get freshness penalties reduced
- Updated content gets freshness reset based on `updated_at` timestamp

### 5. ⭐ Quality Score (10% Default Weight)

**Purpose**: Ensures high-quality, complete content ranks higher

**For Websites**:
- **Title Quality**: Optimal length (10-60 characters) gets bonuses
- **Description Quality**: Good meta descriptions (50-160 characters)
- **URL Validity**: Proper URL formatting and accessibility
- **Content Completeness**: All metadata fields populated
- **Technical Quality**: Valid HTML, fast loading, mobile-friendly

**For Images**:
- **Alt Text Quality**: Meaningful, descriptive alt text
- **Title Presence**: Images with titles get bonuses
- **Availability**: Working images vs broken images
- **Format Optimization**: Modern formats, appropriate sizes
